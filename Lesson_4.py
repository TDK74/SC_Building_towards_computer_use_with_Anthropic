                Customer: Hi Alex, my Acme SmartTherm isn't maintaining the temperature I set. It's
                     set to 72 but the house is much warmer.
                Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. Let's troubleshoot. Is your SmartTherm connected to
                     Wi-Fi?
                Customer: Yes, the Wi-Fi symbol is showing on the display.
                Agent: Great. Let's recalibrate your SmartTherm. Press and hold the menu button for
                     5 seconds.
                Customer: Okay, done. A new menu came up.
                Agent: Perfect. Navigate to "Calibration" and press select. Adjust the temperature
                     to match your room thermometer.
                Customer: Alright, I've set it to 79 degrees to match.
                Agent: Great. Press select to confirm. It will recalibrate, which may take a few
                     minutes. Check back in an hour to see if it's fixed.
                Customer: Okay, I'll do that. Thank you for your help, Alex.

                Agent: I'd be happy to help. Are you using the Acme Smart Home app?
                Customer: Yes, I have the app on my phone.
                Agent: Great. Make sure your phone is connected to the 2.4GHz Wi-Fi network, not the
                     5GHz one.
                Customer: Oh, I'm on the 5GHz network. Should I switch?
                Agent: Yes, please switch to the 2.4GHz network. The SmartCam only works with
                     2.4GHz.
                Customer: Okay, done. Now what?
                Agent: Open the app, select 'Add Device', choose 'SmartCam', and follow the
                     on-screen instructions.
                Customer: It's asking for a password now.
                Agent: Enter your Wi-Fi password and it should connect.
                Customer: It's still not working. I keep getting an error message.
                Agent: I see. In that case, I'd like to escalate this to our technical team. They'll
                     contact you within 24 hours.
                Customer: Okay, that sounds good. Thank you for trying to help.

                Customer: No, that's all for now. Thanks again.

        - Customization options are appreciated
        - Smartphone integration works well
        - Water resistance feature is effective

        - Touch sensitivity issues cause frustration
        - The proposed solution compromises functionality
        - The price doesn't justify the performance
        - The reviewer explicitly states it's not worth the money

        Considering the strength and frequency of sentiments:
        - Positive sentiments are mostly about aesthetics and basic functions
        - Negative sentiments relate to core functionalities and user experience
        - The reviewer uses stronger language for negative aspects ("terrible", "major drawbacks",
         "not worth your money")
        - The conclusion emphasizes disappointment and recommends against purchase

        Based on this analysis, the overall sentiment leans negative. While the reviewer appreciates
         certain aspects, the core issues with battery life, performance, and value for money
         overshadow the positives. The explicit recommendation against purchase is a strong
         indicator of overall negative sentiment.

        Quote: "Sometimes it's overly sensitive, registering accidental touches, while other times

        The analysis of the ABC Smartwatch review reveals a predominantly negative sentiment. While
         the customer appreciates the design, display quality, and some basic features, these
         positives are outweighed by significant issues with core functionalities. The main

         sensitivity, and inadequate problem-solving from customer service. The reviewer concludes
         that the product is not worth the money, emphasizing that the drawbacks are too significant
         to justify the price point.
